# Our Purpose 🌱

## Preamble 
The purpose serves to constitute Radworks, memorializing what we believe and the organization’s raison d’etre. It’s intended as a living document: a North Star that the community can return to for clarity in times of change, challenge, confusion, or conflict. If successful, this document will help protect and further Radwork’s purpose over time as we collectively navigate change. 

## Foundational Beliefs
1. Freedom - That technology should be developed to promote freedom and privacy, no matter where you are in the world.
2. Decentralization - That the internet should be decentralized and governed by its users, rather than controlled by governments or corporations.
3. Security - That technologies should be developed to protect individual privacy and prevent surveillance. 
4. Accessibility - That technologies and information should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of financial status or location.
5. Community - That technology should be developed to promote and harness community, collaboration, and peer-to-peer networks.
6. Resilience - That technology should be developed to be resistant to censorship, capture, and anti-competitive forces.
7. Sustainability - That technology should be developed with a long-term perspective, and should prioritize technical and financial sustainability.
