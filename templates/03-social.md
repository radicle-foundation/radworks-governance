# Social Proposal Template

> ℹ️ **Social Proposals** propose changes that can not be enforced by the DAO on-chain. Use this template as a guide to draft a Social Proposal. This proposal type needs to pass an off-chain Snapshot poll to succeed.
> 
> **Examples of common Social Proposals:**
> - Changes to off-chain governance parameters (e.g. Snapshot thresholds)
> - Updates to DAO-governed resources (e.g. mission/vision/purpose)
> - Revisions to governance documents (e.g. Governance Manual)
>
> **General Info & Tips**
> - Try to keep each section clear and concise!
> - Please include any relevant links or post in each section.

**Social Proposals** must be labeled in the following format:

`[PHASE][RGP - #] - [PROPOSAL TITLE]`

The phase will either be 'Request for Comments (RFC)', 'Formal Review', or 'Submission'. A governance facilitator will update the RGP with the correct number. They will move the proposal from category to category as the proposal makes its way through the governance process.

> 💡 Proposal Authors (the individual(s) who created a proposal) are expected to escalate proposals from phase to phase, with guidance from community moderators. This also means they are responsible for creating forum posts for each stage. If the original Author(s) can’t move a Proposal forward, they are responsible for finding someone to replace them. Any changes needs to be communicated in the proposal.
