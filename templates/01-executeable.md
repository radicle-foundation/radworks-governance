# Executable Proposal Template

> ℹ️ **Executable Proposals** detail on-chain actions such as treasury distributions, updates to contract parameters, and upgrades to the governance system. This proposal type needs to pass both an off-chain Snapshot poll and an on-chain governance submission to succeed. Use this template as a guide to draft an Executable Proposal. 
>
> **Examples of common Executeable Proposals:**
> - Creation of new Orgs (e.g. Grants, Drips, Radicle, Foundation)
> - Funding/defunding of an Org
> - Additional/emergency budget request from an Org
> - Treasury management & diversification (e.g. token swaps, pools, deploy capital on tools/platforms)
> 
> **General Info & Tips**
> - Try to keep each section clear and concise!
> - Please include any relevant links or post in each section.

**Executable Proposals** must be labeled in the following format:

`[PHASE][RGP - #] - [PROPOSAL TITLE]`

The phase will either be 'Request for Comments (RFC)', 'Formal Review', or 'Submission'. A governance facilitator will update the RGP with the correct number. They will move the proposal from category to category as the proposal makes its way through the governance process.

> 💡 Proposal Authors (the individual(s) who created a proposal) are expected to escalate proposals from phase to phase, with guidance from community moderators. This also means they are responsible for creating forum posts for each stage. If the original Author(s) can’t move a Proposal forward, they are responsible for finding someone to replace them. Any changes needs to be communicated in the proposal.
